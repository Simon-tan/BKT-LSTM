# BKT-LSTM


(1) able to assess student's knowledge mastery by using Bayesian Knowledge Tracing
(2) able to detect student's temporal ability profiles (learning transfer) during student knowledge evolution
(3) able to apply problem difficulty in student performance prediction. 



### Data format

First line : the number of skills a student attempted with student ID.
